hmm. 
 at the end i finded how to make an exe file, to use it in another pc etc having database included in that exe file.

1. Make a jar file

2. Copy that jar and the database that's used in , to a folder .

3. You should also copy "jdk" ,JTattto , sqlite or mysql(jdbc) to get connection with that database.

 Enjoy Your applications
